Question 5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.

ans :- A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, iconic image that represents a website. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, bookmarks, tabs, and 
other places to help users quickly identify a website. Favicons contribute to the visual identity of a website and enhance its branding. They are usually square images with a recommended size of 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels.

Here's an illustrative example:

Let's say you have a website named "Example.com." You can create a favicon for your site and save it as a small image file, commonly in the ICO (Icon) format. 
The file is then named "favicon.ico" and is placed in the root directory of your website. The HTML code to link to this favicon is typically included in the <head> section of your HTML document:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Website Title</title>
    <!-- Link to the favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <!-- Optional: Specify the favicon for different devices -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="apple-touch-icon.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="favicon-32x32.png">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="favicon-16x16.png">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
</html>


In this example:

The main favicon is specified using the <link> tag with the rel="icon" attribute.
Optional additional favicons for different devices (such as Apple touch devices and various browser contexts) are also included using the <link> tag.

Keep in mind that the specific filenames and sizes may vary, and it's a good practice to provide multiple sizes to ensure optimal display across various devices.
Including a favicon is a small but important detail that contributes to a professional and recognizable web presence.
